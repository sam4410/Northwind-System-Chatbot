# Northwind-System-Chatbot
Building a RAG based chatbot system given Northwind sales (an organization) data available in public domain. I have added an additional file for incorporating text based "Reviews" data. This RAG solution is aimed at building a chatbot for business leaders which can answer to their subjective, for e.g. what customers are saying about product quality? as well as objective, for e.g. what is total net sales in year 2012 from products belong to "Produce" category kind of questions by querying using natural language.  

The solution leverages the following technological components:
* Python >= 3.10
* Neo4j Aura DB
* Fast API
* Streamlit for UI
* Langchain Framework
* OpenAI API key
